Yet Another Completely Useless Notepad-ish Tool
===============

This is a relatively simple application with the goal of opening a variety of commonly distributed file formats with minimal hassle.

Have you ever exported your phone's contacts to a VCF file then gone to open it 
on your computer  to find it only shows the first contact and pretends the rest aren't there? Or backed up
your calendar to an ICS file and tried to view it only to find the default behaviour is for monolithic
behemoths like Outlook to try to import everything into another calendar? These are the main two examples
which prompted creating this program. I want something which is quick, portable and doesn't mess with things
or leave a trail of changes behind - be it in the file I just opened or on the host computer.

Supported file types (last updated January 2015):
--------------

* .nfo
* .ics (iCal)
* .vcf

It might be relatively small now but YACUNT is very flexible and will keep growing  as demand increases. With
enough time and effort I hope to grow it to the point that you'll be able to open just about anything you can
imagine with YACUNT. The supported file types will be updated much more frequently than the documentation so
so if you find something which doesn't quite fit anywhere else, by all means stick it in YACUNT and see if it
works. If it doesn't then let me know.

Additional benefits:

* YACUNT is specifically designed to be light-weight, portable and fit on most sticks easily. In the unlikely
 event that one stick is too small for YACUNT you can use a tool like (G-Split)[www.gdgsoft.com/gsplit] to spread
 it across more than one at a time.
* YACUNT is regularly health checked and is guaranteed to have no worms and be completely free from any virus.

This software is completely free and open source, so if you liked using YACUNT please spread it around. The more
people who are exposed to YACUNT the better and who knows, yours might be the one Tweet that puts YACUNT on
everyone's lips.

Thank you again for showing an interest in YACUNT!
